    - Overall playtime
    - Last played time

    - include_appinfo
    Include game name and logo information in the output. The default is to return appids only.
    - include_played_free_games
    By default, free games like Team Fortress 2 are excluded (as technically everyone owns them).
    If include_played_free_games is set, they will be returned if the player has played them at some point.
    This is the same behavior as the games list on the Steam Community.
